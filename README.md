# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

Submission for Module 3 of the University of Birmingham Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development &amp; UX

FOr this assignment, there was no starter code and I built the skeleton HTML from scratch. This project uses the Bootstrap library for styling of the web app.

The production website is deployed [here](https://stefan4d.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/).

## Learning Outcome

I have learned how to make use of the Bootstrap library for rapidly prototyping and iterating on an application design.

I found the Bootstrap Grid system to much simpler to use than the raw CSS required to build out a grid or a set of flexbox containers and items.

## Resources Used

In completing this challenge exercise, I made use of the following resources:

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Net Ninja: Bootstrap 5 Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR)
- [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)
- [Huemint Bootstrap Theme Generator](https://huemint.com/bootstrap-plus/)
